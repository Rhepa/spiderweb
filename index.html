	<h1>Website as a spider web</h1>

	<p>
		A website can be like a spider web. When a spider begins to construct their web, they start by anchoring the silk thread to an object . When we begin creating our website, we  must start by establishing what we want our website to be about, how we want it to look and where we want to upload; similar to anchoring the silk thread to a starting base.
		
</p>
<br>
<p>
The spider then proceeds to build the web and eventually when it is done, it is mostly used as a hunting tool. Similarly, when we are done creating our website, we will try to get views, or customers. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
However, when spider webs are no longer useful, spiders proceed to either destroy it or eat it in order to recycle it but they may leave a heavy bridge so they can rebuild it later.
</p>

<p>
It is the same as websites. Websites are reused, updated, adjusted and sometimes gone, but it can be rebuilt if the files are saved.
